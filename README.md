## üìã Overview

This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based system to detect skin diseases using ensemble learning techniques. The system analyzes images of skin conditions to classify various diseases, helping improve diagnosis accuracy. Ensemble learning combines multiple algorithms to enhance predictive accuracy, offering a robust approach to handling complex and diverse medical image data.

## üîß Installation

### Prerequisites

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
2. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
3. [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
4. [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (optional if using cloud MongoDB)

### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Purvesh-PJ/skin_disease_detection.git
cd skin_disease_detection
```

#### 2. Backend Setup (Python/Flask)

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Create and activate Conda environment
conda create --name skin_disease_env python=3.12.0
conda activate skin_disease_env

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up dataset
mkdir -p app/data
# Download the HAM10000 dataset from Kaggle:
# https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000
# Extract in app/data folder and rename to Ham10000

# Start the Flask server
python main.py
```

The backend server will run on http://localhost:5000

#### 3. Frontend Setup (React)

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory (from project root)
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

The React application will run on http://localhost:3000

## üìä Dataset

This project uses the [HAM10000 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000), which contains 10,000 dermatoscopic images of pigmented skin lesions across seven different disease categories:

- Actinic keratoses (akiec)
- Basal cell carcinoma (bcc)
- Benign keratosis-like lesions (bkl)
- Dermatofibroma (df)
- Melanoma (mel)
- Melanocytic nevi (nv)
- Vascular lesions (vasc)

## üß† Model Architecture

The project implements an ensemble learning approach combining:

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Random Forests
- Gradient Boosting

This ensemble approach improves prediction accuracy by leveraging the strengths of multiple algorithms.

## üîí Authentication

The application uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication. Users need to register and log in to access the disease prediction functionality.

## üöÄ Usage

1. Register/Login to the application
2. Navigate to the disease prediction tool
3. Upload an image of the skin condition
4. Wait for the analysis to complete
5. View the detailed results including:
   - Predicted disease
   - Confidence score
   - Disease information and recommendations
